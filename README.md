# Artistic Box Model

This is a React app demonstrating a creative implementation of CSS Box Model with interactive effects. The boxes are rotated upon hovering, and a third box rotates randomly every second.

## Features

- **Responsive design**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive**: Hover over the first two boxes to see them rotate.
- **Random animation**: The third box randomly rotates every second.
- **Visually appealing**: Background color and box model design using CSS transforms and blur effects.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For building the UI components.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to the app.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling and custom responsiveness.
